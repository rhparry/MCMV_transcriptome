# MCMV_transcriptome
Supports the transcriptome data from publication: "Global transcriptional reprogramming by cytomegalovirus infection suppresses antigen presentation while enhancing migration machinery in murine dendritic cells."
Data tables are as follows:
•	S2_Mockvs_IC2.csv Table S2: Differentially expressed genes in wild-type (IC2) MCMV infected cells compared to Mock.
•	S3_Mockvs_NQY.csv Table S3: Differentially expressed genes in M33NQY MCMV infection compared to Mock.
•	S4_IC2vsNQY_DEGs.csv Table S4: Differentially expressed genes between MCMV-IC2-infected versus MCMV-NQY-infected cells 
•	S5_Mockvs_IC2_KEGG-RA-BP-CC-MF_IC2_vs_Mock.csv Table S5: easyGSEA results of wild-type (IC2) MCMV infected cells compared to Mock.
•	S6_Mockvs_NQY_KEGG-RA-BP-CC-MF_NQY_vs_Mock.csv Table S6: easyGSEA results in M33NQY MCMV infected cells compared to Mock.
•	S7_IC2vsNQY_DEGs_KEGG-RA-BP-CC-MF_IC2_verses_NQY.csv Table S7: easyGSEA results in MCMV-IC2-infected versus MCMV-NQY-infected cells.

Addtional files are "Interactome_Map.cys" The cytoscape map for Figure 3C, "Normlist_mouse_genes.csv" contains normalised mm10 gene count data and "Normlist_MCMVgenes.csv" for the normalised MCMV gene data.
