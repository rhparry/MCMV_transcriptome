# MCMV_transcriptome

**Supports the publication:**  
**_Global transcriptional reprogramming by cytomegalovirus infection suppresses antigen presentation while enhancing migration machinery in murine dendritic cells._**

This repository provides processed transcriptomic data and network files generated from the RNA-seq analysis of murine dendritic cells infected with wild-type MCMV or a signaling-deficient M33 mutant (M33NQY). The data support the figures and supplementary tables described in the manuscript.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

### Differential Gene Expression Tables
- `S2_Mockvs_IC2.csv`  
  **Table S2**: Differentially expressed genes in wild-type (IC2) MCMV-infected cells vs. mock-infected controls.

- `S3_Mockvs_NQY.csv`  
  **Table S3**: Differentially expressed genes in M33NQY-infected cells vs. mock-infected controls.

- `S4_IC2vsNQY_DEGs.csv`  
  **Table S4**: Differentially expressed genes in wild-type (IC2) vs. M33NQY-infected cells.

### Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (easyGSEA) Output
- `S5_Mockvs_IC2_KEGG-RA-BP-CC-MF_IC2_vs_Mock.csv`  
  **Table S5**: easyGSEA results (KEGG, Reactome, GO:BP/CC/MF) comparing IC2 vs. mock.

- `S6_Mockvs_NQY_KEGG-RA-BP-CC-MF_NQY_vs_Mock.csv`  
  **Table S6**: easyGSEA results comparing M33NQY vs. mock.

- `S7_IC2vsNQY_DEGs_KEGG-RA-BP-CC-MF_IC2_verses_NQY.csv`  
  **Table S7**: easyGSEA results comparing IC2 vs. M33NQY.

### Expression Data
- `Normlist_mouse_genes.csv`  
  TMM-normalized count data for mouse genes (mm10), generated via edgeR and used for expression analysis in Figures 1‚Äì3.

- `Normlist_MCMVgenes.csv`  
  TMM-normalized count data for MCMV genes generated via edgeR and used for expression analysis in Figure 4.

### Network Files
- `Interactome_Map.cys`  
  Cytoscape network file for Figure 3C. This includes merged antigen presentation and leukocyte migration networks, annotated with log‚ÇÇ fold change and betweenness centrality.
